You can not drive your car looking in the rear view mirror. If you keep looking in the rear view mirror. You are going to keep crashing your car. There is reason why the rear view mirror's smailler than the windshield ! Right ! Pursuing your passion ! "Rise Again"

When shadows fall and hope seems far, And dreams lie broken where they are, Don’t let the silence steal your flame— Stand tall, and rise beyond the pain.

The road is rough, the hills are steep, The nights are long, the wounds run deep. But every scar tells where you've been— A map of strength that lies within.

Each failure is a stepping stone, A voice that says, “You're not alone.” For storms will pass, and skies will clear, And every fall brings triumph near.

So lift your eyes and take the fight, Hold tight your heart, pursue the light. Success is born from trials faced— A crown that's earned, not merely placed.
